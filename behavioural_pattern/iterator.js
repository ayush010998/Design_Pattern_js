/**
 * The iterator is used to traverse elements of a collection. This might sound trivial in programming languages used nowadays, but this wasn't always the case.

Anyway, any of the JavaScript built in functions we have at our disposal to iterate over data structures (for, forEach, for...of, for...in, map, reduce, filter, and so on) are examples of the iterator pattern.
