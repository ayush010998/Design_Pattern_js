//singleton design pattern

// Singleton is a design pattern that insures that a class have only one immutable instances.Singleton Pattern consists of an object that can't be copied or modified. it's often useful when we want to have some immutable single point of truth for our applications.

// Using an object literals

const Config = {
  start: () => console.log('App has started'),
  update: () => console.log('App has updated'),
}

// We freeze the object to prevent new properties being added and existing properties being modified or removed
Object.freeze(Config)

Config.start() // "App has started"
Config.update() // "App has updated"

Config.name = "Robert" // We try to add a new key
console.log(Config) // And verify it doesn't work: { start: [Function: start], update: [Function: update] }



//using classes
class Config {
    constructor() {}
    start(){ console.log('App has started') }  
    update(){ console.log('App has updated') }
}
  
const instance = new Config()
Object.freeze(instance)
